# ComposerPreview

Description
My app that emails a concatenated preview URL for a given composer preview URL


To use the google smtp service to send the preview URL you need to generate an app key:

1. Sign at https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords

2. From the dropdwi=on select "Other (customize name) - give it a name and generate a key

3. In the Main class set the following:
	String Username = "[YOUR USERNAME HERE"
	String PWD = "[NEW KEY]"
4. Run the app
